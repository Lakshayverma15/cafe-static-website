# cafe-static-website


## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project involves hosting a static website for a fictional cafÃ© using **Amazon S3**.  
The site showcases the cafÃ©'s offerings, location, hours, and contact details.  
It follows AWS best practices for **data protection, cost optimization, and disaster recovery**.

---

## ðŸ›  AWS Services Used
- **Amazon S3** â€“ Website hosting, versioning, lifecycle policies, and cross-region replication
- **IAM** â€“ Role (`CafeRole`) for replication permissions
- **S3 Lifecycle Policies** â€“ Storage class transitions and expiration
- **S3 Bucket Policy** â€“ Public read access for objects

---

## ðŸ“‚ Architecture
The final architecture contains:
1. **Source S3 Bucket** (us-east-1) â€“ Hosts static site
2. **Destination S3 Bucket** (another AWS region) â€“ Cross-Region Replication target
3. **Versioning** â€“ Prevents accidental overwrites/deletions
4. **Lifecycle Policies** â€“ Cost optimization for older object versions
5. **Bucket Policy** â€“ Grants public read access

## ðŸš€ Features Implemented
### **Challenge 1: Static Website Hosting**
- Created S3 bucket in `us-east-1`
- Enabled **static website hosting**
- Uploaded HTML, CSS, and images
- Applied public bucket policy for read access

### **Challenge 2: Data Protection**
- Enabled **S3 Versioning**
- Tested by modifying `index.html`
- Verified previous versions are retained

### **Challenge 3: Cost Optimization**
- Configured **Lifecycle Rules**:
  - Move previous versions to **S3 Standard-IA** after 30 days
  - Delete previous versions after 365 days

### **Challenge 4: Disaster Recovery**
- Created destination bucket in a different region
- Enabled **Cross-Region Replication**
- Verified new changes replicated successfully
